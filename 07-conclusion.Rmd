# Conclusion

The data from the world overview lends some credibility to the idea of the Domino Theory, today the western world and nearby countries are largely democratic, while the same cannot be said for our eastern counterparts. There's evidence that this will not be forever though. As illustrated by the our animated map, the world is volatile, constantly changing by the year, and the trend points towards a more democratic future.

We can see what is happening inside an authoritarian regime by looking at the elites that are leaving it. Similar to what happens in a company that is going sour, the turnover rate increases as the regime declines or faces a change. Internal power struggles lead to rapid turnovers as well, affecting party related officials the most. Although it is hard to look into an authoritarian regime, the people running it gives the most hint on where it is headed to.
